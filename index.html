    <p>This specification defines an API that provides the time origin, and
    current time in sub-millisecond resolution, such that it is not subject to
    system clock skew or adjustments.</p>

  <section id="introduction" class='informative'>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The ECMAScript Language specification [[ECMA-262]] defines the
    <code><dfn data-no-export="" data-cite=
    "ECMA-262#sec-date-objects">Date</dfn></code> object as a time value
    representing time in milliseconds since 01 January, 1970 UTC. For most
    purposes, this definition of time is sufficient as these values represent
    time to millisecond precision for any instant that is within approximately
    285,616 years from 01 January, 1970 UTC. The {{DOMTimeStamp}} is defined
    similarly [[WEBIDL]].</p>
    <p>In practice, these definitions of time are subject to both clock skew
    and adjustment of the system clock. The value of time may not always be
    monotonically increasing and subsequent values may either decrease or
    remain the same.</p>
    <p>For example, the following script may record a positive number, negative
    number, or zero for computed <code>duration</code>:</p>
    <pre class='example js'>
      var mark_start = Date.now();
      doTask(); // Some task
      var duration = Date.now() - mark_start;
    </pre>
    <p>For certain tasks this definition of time may not be sufficient as it:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Does not have a stable monotonic clock, and as a result, it is subject to system clock skew.</li>
      <li>Does not provide sub-millisecond time resolution.</li>
    </ul>
    <p data-link-for="Performance">This specification does not propose changing the behavior of
    <code><dfn data-no-export="" data-cite=
    'ecma-262#sec-date.now'>Date.now()</dfn></code> [[ECMA-262]] as it is
    genuinely useful in determining the current value of the calendar time and
    has a long history of usage. The {{DOMHighResTimeStamp}} type,
    <code>performance.</code>{{now}} method, and <code>performance.</code>{{timeOrigin}} attributes of
    the {{Performance}} interface resolve the above issues by providing
    monotonically increasing time values with sub-millisecond resolution.</p>
    <p class=note>Providing sub-millisecond resolution is not a mandatory part
    of this specification.  Implementations may choose to limit the timer
    resolution they expose for privacy and security reasons, and not expose
    sub-millisecond timers. Use-cases that rely on sub-millisecond resolution
    may not be satisfied when that happens.</p>
    <section id='use-cases' class='informative'>
      <h3>Use-cases</h3>
      <p>This specification defines a few different capabilities: it provides
        timestamps based on a stable, monotonic clock, comparable across
        contexts, with potential sub-millisecond resolution.</p>

      <p>The need for a stable monotonic clock when talking about performance
        measurements stems from the fact that unrelated clock skew can distort
        measurements and render them useless. For example, when attempting to
        accurately measure the elapsed time of navigating to a Document,
        fetching of resources or execution of script, a monotonically
        increasing clock with sub-millisecond resolution is desired.</li>

      <p>Comparing timestamps between contexts is essential e.g. when
        synchronizing work between a {{Worker}} and the main thread or when
        instrumenting such work in order to create a unified view of the event
        timeline.</p>

      <p>Finally, the need for sub-millisecond timers revolves around the
        following use-cases:</p>
      <p><ul>
        <li>Ability to schedule work in sub-millisecond intervals. That is
          particularly important on the main thread, where work can interfere
          with frame rendering which needs to happen in short and regular
          intervals, to avoid user-visible jank.</li>
        <li>When calculating the frame rate of a script-based animation,
          developers will need sub-millisecond resolution in order to determine if
          an animation is drawing at 60 FPS. Without sub-millisecond resolution, a
          developer can only determine if an animation is drawing at 58.8 FPS
          (1000ms / 16) or 62.5 FPS (1000ms / 17).</li>
        <li>When collecting in-the-wild measurements of JS code (e.g. using
          User-Timing), developers may be interested in gathering
          sub-milliseconds timing of their functions, to catch regressions
          early.</li>
        <li>When attempting to cue audio to a specific point in an animation or
          ensure that the audio and animation are perfectly synchronized,
          developers will need to accurately measure the amount of time
          elapsed.</li>
      </ul></p>

      <h3>Examples</h3>
      <p data-link-for="Performance">A developer may wish to construct a timeline of their entire
      application, including events from {{Worker}} or {{SharedWorker}}, which
      have different <a>time origin</a>s. To display such events on the same

      with the help of the <code>performance.</code>{{timeOrigin}} attribute.</p>

    <p class="note">In certain scenarios (e.g. when a tab is backgrounded), the

    <h3>Privacy and Security</h3>
    <section>
      <h3>Clock resolution</h3>
      <p>Access to accurate timing information, both for measurement and
      scheduling purposes, is a common requirement for many applications. For
      example, coordinating animations, sound, and other activity on the page
      requires access to high-resolution time to provide a good user
      experience. Similarly, measurement enables developers to track the
      performance of critical code components, detect regressions, and so
      on.</p>
      <p>However, access to the same accurate timing information can sometimes
      be also used for malicious purposes by an attacker to guess and infer
      data that they can't see or access otherwise. For example, cache attacks,
      statistical fingerprinting and microarchitectural attacks are a privacy
      and security concern where a malicious web site may use high resolution
      timing data of various browser or application-initiated operations to
      differentiate between subset of users, identify a particular user or
      reveal unrelated but same-process user data - see [[?CACHE-ATTACKS]] and
      [[SPECTRE]] for more background.</p>
      <p data-tests='timing-attack.html'>This specification defines an API that
      provides sub-millisecond time resolution, which is more accurate than the
      previously available millisecond resolution exposed by {{DOMTimeStamp}}.
      However, even without this new API an attacker may be able to obtain
      high-resolution estimates through repeat execution and statistical
      analysis.</p>
      <p>To ensure that the new API does not significantly improve the
      accuracy or speed of such attacks, the minimum resolution of the
      {{DOMHighResTimeStamp}} type should be inaccurate enough to prevent
      attacks.</p>

      <p>Where necessary, the user agent should set higher resolution values to
      |time resolution| in [=coarsen time=]'s processing model, to address
      privacy and security concerns due to architecture or software constraints,
      or other considerations.</p>

      <p>In order to mitigate such attacks user agents may deploy any technique
      they deem necessary. Deployment of those techniques may vary based on the
      browser's architecture, the user's device, the content and its ability to
      maliciously read cross-origin data, or other practical
      considerations.</p>
      <p>These techniques may include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Resolution reduction.</li>
        <li>Added jitter.</li>
        <li>Abuse detection and/or API call throttling.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Mitigating such timing side-channel attacks entirely is practically
      impossible: either all operations would have to execute in a time that
      does not vary based on the value of any confidential information, or the
      application would need to be isolated from any time-related primitives
      (clock, timers, counters, etc). Neither is practical due to the
      associated complexity for the browser and application developers and the
      associated negative effects on performance and responsiveness of
      applications.</p>
      <div class="note">
        Clock resolution is an unsolved and evolving area of research, with no

      <h3>Clock drift</h3>
      <p>This specification also defines an API that provides sub-millisecond
      time resolution of the zero time of the time origin, which requires and
      exposes a <a>shared monotonic clock</a> to the application, and that must
      be shared across all the browser contexts. The <a>shared monotonic
      clock</a> does not need to be tied to physical time, but is recommended
      to be set with respect to the [[ECMA-262]] definition of <a>time</a> to
      avoid exposing new fingerprint entropy about the user — e.g. this time
      can already be easily obtained by the application, whereas exposing a new
      logical clock provides new information.</p>
      <p>However, even with the above mechanism in place, the <a>shared
      monotonic clock</a> may provide additional <a href=
      "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_drift">clock drift</a> resolution.
      Today, the application can timestamp the time-of-day and monotonic time
      values (via <a>Date.now()</a> and {{Performance.now()}}) at multiple
      points within the same context and observe drift between them—e.g. due to
      automatic or user clock adjustments. With the {{Performance.timeOrigin}}
      attribute, the attacker can also compare the time at which <a>time
      origin</a> is zero, as reported by the <a>shared monotonic clock</a>,
      against the current time-of-day estimate of when it is zero (i.e. the
      difference between `Date.now()-performance.now()` and
      `performance.timeOrigin`) and potentially observe clock drift between
      these clocks over a longer time period.</p>
      <p>In practice, the same time drift can be observed by an application
      across multiple navigations: the application can record the logical time
      in each context and use a client or server time synchronization mechanism
      to infer changes in the user's clock. Similarly, lower-layer mechanisms
      such as TCP timestamps may reveal the same high-resolution information to
      the server without the need for multiple visits. As such, the information
      provided by this API should not expose any significant or previously
      unavailable entropy about the user.</p>
