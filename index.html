      <h2>
        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        The ECMAScript Language specification [[ECMA-262]] defines the
        <code><dfn data-no-export="" data-cite=
        "ECMA-262#sec-date-objects">Date</dfn></code> object as a time value
        representing time in milliseconds since 01 January, 1970 UTC. For most
        purposes, this definition of time is sufficient as these values
        represent time to millisecond precision for any moment that is within
        approximately 285,616 years from 01 January, 1970 UTC.
      </p>
      <p>
        In practice, these definitions of time are subject to both clock skew
        and adjustment of the system clock. The value of time may not always be
        monotonically increasing and subsequent values may either decrease or
        remain the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, the following script may record a positive number,
        negative number, or zero for computed <code>duration</code>:
      </p>
      <pre class="example js">
      var mark_start = Date.now();
      doTask(); // Some task
      var duration = Date.now() - mark_start;
    </pre>
      <p>
        For certain tasks this definition of time may not be sufficient as it:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Does not have a stable monotonic clock, and as a result, it is
        subject to system clock skew.
        </li>
        <li>Does not provide sub-millisecond time resolution.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This specification does not propose changing the behavior of
        <code><dfn data-no-export="" data-cite=
        "ecma-262#sec-date.now">Date.now()</dfn></code> [[ECMA-262]] as it is
        genuinely useful in determining the current value of the calendar time
        and has a long history of usage. The {{DOMHighResTimeStamp}} type,
        {{Performance}}.{{Performance/now()}} method, and
        {{Performance}}.{{Performance/timeOrigin}} attributes of the
        {{Performance}} interface resolve the above issues by providing
        monotonically increasing time values with sub-millisecond resolution.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        Providing sub-millisecond resolution is not a mandatory part of this
        specification. Implementations may choose to limit the timer resolution
        they expose for privacy and security reasons, and not expose
        sub-millisecond timers. Use-cases that rely on sub-millisecond
        resolution may not be satisfied when that happens.
      </p>
      <section id="use-cases" class="informative">
        <h3>
          Use-cases
        </h3>
        <p>
          This specification defines a few different capabilities: it provides
          timestamps based on a stable, monotonic clock, comparable across
          contexts, with potential sub-millisecond resolution.
        </p>
        <p>
          The need for a stable monotonic clock when talking about performance
          measurements stems from the fact that unrelated clock skew can
          distort measurements and render them useless. For example, when
          attempting to accurately measure the elapsed time of navigating to a
          Document, fetching of resources or execution of script, a
          monotonically increasing clock with sub-millisecond resolution is
          desired.
        </p>
        <p>
          Comparing timestamps between contexts is essential e.g. when
          synchronizing work between a {{Worker}} and the main thread or when
          instrumenting such work in order to create a unified view of the
          event timeline.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, the need for sub-millisecond timers revolves around the
          following use-cases:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ability to schedule work in sub-millisecond intervals. That is
          particularly important on the main thread, where work can interfere
          with frame rendering which needs to happen in short and regular
          intervals, to avoid user-visible jank.
          </li>
          <li>When calculating the frame rate of a script-based animation,
          developers will need sub-millisecond resolution in order to determine
          if an animation is drawing at 60 FPS. Without sub-millisecond
          resolution, a developer can only determine if an animation is drawing
          at 58.8 FPS (1000ms / 16) or 62.5 FPS (1000ms / 17).
          </li>
          <li>When collecting in-the-wild measurements of JS code (e.g. using
          User-Timing), developers may be interested in gathering
          sub-milliseconds timing of their functions, to catch regressions
          early.
          </li>
          <li>When attempting to cue audio to a specific point in an animation
          or ensure that the audio and animation are perfectly synchronized,
          developers will need to accurately measure the amount of time
          elapsed.
          </li>
        </ul>

          A developer may wish to construct a timeline of their entire
          application, including events from {{Worker}} or {{SharedWorker}},
          which have different [=environment settings object/time origins=]. To
          display such events on the same timeline, the application can
          translate the {{DOMHighResTimeStamp}}s with the help of the
          {{Performance}}.{{Performance/timeOrigin}} attribute.

          A <dfn>clock</dfn> tracks the passage of time and can report the
          <dfn>unsafe current time</dfn> that an algorithm step is executing.
          There are many kinds of clocks. All clocks on the web platform
          attempt to count 1 millisecond of clock time per 1 millisecond of
          real-world time, but they differ in how they handle cases where they
          can't be exactly correct.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The <dfn data-export="">wall clock</dfn>'s <dfn data-dfn-for=
          "wall clock" data-export="" id=
          "wall-clock-unsafe-current-time">unsafe current time</dfn> is always
          as close as possible to a user's notion of time. Since a computer
          sometimes runs slow or fast or loses track of time, its [=wall
          clock=] sometimes needs to be adjusted, which means the [=wall
          clock/unsafe current time=] can decrease, making it unreliable for
          performance measurement or recording the orders of events. The web
          platform shares a [=wall clock=] with [[ECMA-262]]
          <dfn data-no-export="" data-cite=
          "ECMA-262#sec-time-values-and-time-range">time</dfn>.

              "monotonic-clock-unsafe-current-time">unsafe current time</dfn>
              never decreases, so it can't be changed by system clock
              adjustments. The [=monotonic clock=] only exists within a single
              execution of the [=user agent=], so it can't be used to compare
              events that might happen in different executions.
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              Since the [=monotonic clock=] can't be adjusted to match the
              user's notion of time, it should be used for measurement, rather
              than user-visible times. For any time communication with the
              user, use the wall clock.
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              The user agent can pick a new [=estimated monotonic time of the
              Unix epoch=] when the browser restarts, when it starts an
              isolated browsing session—e.g. incognito or a similar browsing
              mode—or when it creates an [=environment settings object=] that
              can't communicate with any existing settings objects. As a
              result, developers should not use shared timestamps as absolute
              time that holds its monotonic properties across all past,
              present, and future contexts; in practice, the monotonic
              properties only apply for contexts that can reach each other by
              exchanging messages via one of the provided messaging mechanisms
              - e.g. {{Window/postMessage(message, options)}},
              {{BroadcastChannel}}, etc.
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              In certain scenarios (e.g. when a tab is backgrounded), the user
              agent may choose to throttle timers and periodic callbacks run in
              that context or even freeze them entirely. Any such throttling
              should not affect the resolution or accuracy of the time returned
              by the monotonic clock.

          Moments and Durations

        <p>
          Each [=clock=]'s [=unsafe current time=] returns an <dfn>unsafe
          moment</dfn>. [=Coarsen time=] converts these [=unsafe moments=] to
          <dfn data-export="" data-lt="moment">coarsened moments</dfn> or just
          [=moments=]. [=Unsafe moments=] and [=moments=] from different clocks
          are not comparable.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          [=Moments=] and [=unsafe moments=] represent points in time, which
          means they can't be directly stored as numbers. Implementations will
          usually represent a [=moment=] as a [=duration=] from some other
          fixed point in time, but specifications ought to deal in the
          [=moments=] themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <dfn data-export="">duration</dfn> is the distance from one
          [=moment=] to another from the same [=clock=]. Neither endpoint can
          be an [=unsafe moment=] so that both [=durations=] and differences of
          [=durations=] mitigate the concerns in [[[#clock-resolution]]].
          [=Durations=] are measured in milliseconds, seconds, etc. Since all
          [=clocks=] attempt to count at the same rate, [=durations=] don't
          have an associated [=clock=], and a [=duration=] calculated from two
          [=moments=] on one clock can be added to a [=moment=] from a second
          [=clock=], to produce another [=moment=] on that second [=clock=].
        </p>
        <p>
          The <dfn data-export="">duration from</dfn> |a:moment| to |b:moment|
          is the result of the following algorithm:
        </p>
        <ol class="algorithm">
          <li>Assert: |a| was created by the same [=clock=] as |b|.

          </li>
          <li>Return the amount of time from |a| to |b| as a [=duration=]. If
          |b| came before |a|, this will be a negative [=duration=].
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          [=Durations=] can be used implicitly as {{DOMHighResTimeStamp}}s. To

          Clock resolution

        <p>
          Access to accurate timing information, both for measurement and
          scheduling purposes, is a common requirement for many applications.
          For example, coordinating animations, sound, and other activity on
          the page requires access to high-resolution time to provide a good
          user experience. Similarly, measurement enables developers to track
          the performance of critical code components, detect regressions, and
          so on.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, access to the same accurate timing information can sometimes
          be also used for malicious purposes by an attacker to guess and infer
          data that they can't see or access otherwise. For example, cache
          attacks, statistical fingerprinting and micro-architectural attacks
          are a privacy and security concern where a malicious web site may use
          high resolution timing data of various browser or
          application-initiated operations to differentiate between subset of
          users, identify a particular user or reveal unrelated but
          same-process user data - see [[?CACHE-ATTACKS]] and [[SPECTRE]] for
          more background.
        </p>
        <p data-tests="timing-attack.html">
          This specification defines an API that provides sub-millisecond time
          resolution, which is more accurate than the previously available
          millisecond resolution exposed by {{EpochTimeStamp}}. However, even
          without this new API an attacker may be able to obtain
          high-resolution estimates through repeat execution and statistical
          analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
          To ensure that the new API does not significantly improve the
          accuracy or speed of such attacks, the minimum resolution of the
          {{DOMHighResTimeStamp}} type should be inaccurate enough to prevent
          attacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where necessary, the user agent should set higher resolution values
          to |time resolution| in [=coarsen time=]'s processing model, to
          address privacy and security concerns due to architecture or software
          constraints, or other considerations.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to mitigate such attacks user agents may deploy any
          technique they deem necessary. Deployment of those techniques may
          vary based on the browser's architecture, the user's device, the
          content and its ability to maliciously read cross-origin data, or
          other practical considerations.
        </p>
        <p>
          These techniques may include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Resolution reduction.
          </li>
          <li>Added jitter.
          </li>
          <li>Abuse detection and/or API call throttling.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Mitigating such timing side-channel attacks entirely is practically
          impossible: either all operations would have to execute in a time
          that does not vary based on the value of any confidential
          information, or the application would need to be isolated from any
          time-related primitives (clock, timers, counters, etc). Neither is
          practical due to the associated complexity for the browser and
          application developers and the associated negative effects on
          performance and responsiveness of applications.

          Clock drift
        </h3>
        <p>
          This specification also defines an API that provides sub-millisecond
          time resolution of the zero time of the time origin, which requires
          and exposes a <a>monotonic clock</a> to the application, and that
          must be shared across all the browser contexts. The <a>monotonic
          clock</a> does not need to be tied to physical time, but is
          recommended to be set with respect to the [[ECMA-262]] definition of
          <a>time</a> to avoid exposing new fingerprint entropy about the user
          — e.g. this time can already be easily obtained by the application,
          whereas exposing a new logical clock provides new information.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, even with the above mechanism in place, the <a>monotonic
          clock</a> may provide additional <a href=
          "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_drift">clock drift</a>
          resolution. Today, the application can timestamp the time-of-day and
          monotonic time values (via <a>Date.now()</a> and
          {{Performance/now()}}) at multiple points within the same context and
          observe drift between them—e.g. due to automatic or user clock
          adjustments. With the {{Performance/timeOrigin}} attribute, the
          attacker can also compare the [=environment settings object/time
          origin=], as reported by the <a>monotonic clock</a>, against the
          current time-of-day estimate of the [=environment settings
          object/time origin=] (i.e. the difference between
          `performance.timeOrigin` and `Date.now() - performance.now()`) and
          potentially observe clock drift between these clocks over a longer
          time period.
        </p>
        <p>
          In practice, the same time drift can be observed by an application
          across multiple navigations: the application can record the logical
          time in each context and use a client or server time synchronization
          mechanism to infer changes in the user's clock. Similarly,
          lower-layer mechanisms such as TCP timestamps may reveal the same
          high-resolution information to the server without the need for
          multiple visits. As such, the information provided by this API should
          not expose any significant or previously unavailable entropy about
          the user.

      <p>
        The current definition of [=environment settings object/time origin=]
        for a {{Document}} exposes the total time of cross-origin redirects
        prior to the request arriving at the document's origin. This exposes
        cross-origin information, however it's not yet decided how to mitigate
        this without causing major breakages to performance metrics.

        Some conformance requirements are phrased as requirements on
        attributes, methods or objects. Such requirements are to be interpreted
        as requirements on user agents.
