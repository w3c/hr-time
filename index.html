    </ul>
  </section>
  <section id="introduction" class='informative'>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The ECMAScript Language specification [[ECMA-262]] defines the
    <code><dfn data-no-export="" data-cite=
    "ECMA-262#sec-date-objects">Date</dfn></code> object as a time value
    representing time in milliseconds since 01 January, 1970 UTC. For most
    purposes, this definition of time is sufficient as these values represent
    time to millisecond precision for any instant that is within approximately
    285,616 years from 01 January, 1970 UTC. The {{DOMTimeStamp}} is defined
    similarly [[WEBIDL]].</p>
    <p>In practice, these definitions of time are subject to both clock skew
    and adjustment of the system clock. The value of time may not always be
    monotonically increasing and subsequent values may either decrease or
    remain the same.</p>
    <p>For example, the following script may record a positive number, negative
    number, or zero for computed <code>duration</code>:</p>
    <pre class='example js'>
      var mark_start = Date.now();
      doTask(); // Some task
      var duration = Date.now() - mark_start;
    </pre>
    <p>For certain tasks this definition of time may not be sufficient as it
    does not allow for sub-millisecond resolution and is subject to system
    clock skew. For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>When attempting to accurately measure the elapsed time of navigating
      to a Document, fetching of resources or execution of script, a
      monotonically increasing clock with sub-millisecond resolution is
      desired.</li>
      <li>When calculating the animation state from script, developers will
      need to accurately know the amount of time that has elapsed in the
      animation in order to properly update the next scene of the
      animation.</li>
      <li>When calculating the frame rate of a script based animation,
      developers will need sub-millisecond resolution in order to determine if
      an animation is drawing at 60 FPS. Without sub-millisecond resolution, a
      developer can only determine if an animation is drawing at 58.8 FPS or
      62.5 FPS.</li>
      <li>When attempting to cue audio to a specific point in an animation or
      ensure that the audio is synchronized with the animation, developers will
      need to accurately know the amount of time elapsed in the animation and
      audio.</li>
      <li>When multiple contexts need to synchronize work with sub-millisecond
      resolution (e.g. when using {{Worker}} or {{SharedWorker}} workers to
      drive animation, audio, etc., in a renderer context), or to create a
      unified view of the event timeline.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This specification does not propose changing the behavior of
    <code><dfn data-no-export="" data-cite=
    'ecma-262#sec-date.now'>Date.now()</dfn></code> [[ECMA-262]] as it is
    genuinely useful in determining the current value of the calendar time and
    has a long history of usage. The {{DOMHighResTimeStamp}} type,
    {{Performance.now}} method, and {{performance.timeOrigin}} attributes of
    the {{Performance}} interface resolve above issues by providing
    monotonically increasing time values with sub-millisecond resolution.</p>
    <section id='examples' class='informative'>
      <h3>Examples</h3>
      <p>A developer may wish to construct a timeline of their entire
      application, including events from {{Worker}} or {{SharedWorker}}, which
      have different <a>time origin</a>'s. To display such events on the same
      timeline, the application can translate the {{DOMHighResTimeStamp}}'s
      with the help of the {{performance.timeOrigin}} attribute.</p>
      <pre class="example js">
        // ---- worker.js -----------------------------
        // Shared worker script
        onconnect = function(e) {

          port.onmessage = function(e) {
            // Time execution in worker
            var task_start = performance.now();

    <h3>Time Origin</h3>
    <p>The <dfn data-export="">time origin</dfn> is the time value from which
    time is measured:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the [=Realm/global object=] is a {{Window}} object, the <a>time

          <li>otherwise, the time of the user confirming the navigation during
          the previous document's <a data-cite=
          "HTML/browsing-the-web.html#prompt-to-unload-a-document">prompt to

      <li>Otherwise, the <a>time origin</a> is undefined.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The <dfn data-export="">time origin timestamp</dfn> is the high
    resolution time value at which <a>time origin</a> is zero. To obtain the
    <a>time origin timestamp</a> given a [=Realm/global object=]
    (<var>global</var>):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Assert that <var>global</var>'s <a>time origin</a> is not undefined.

    global timestamps as absolute time that holds its monotonic properties
    across all past, present, and future contexts; in practice, the monotonic
    properties only apply for contexts that can reach other by exchanging
    messages via one of the provided messaging mechanisms - e.g. `postMessage`,
    `BroadcastChannel`, etc.</p>
    <p class="note">In certain scenarios (e.g. when a tab is backgrounded), the
    user agent may choose to throttle timers and periodic callbacks run in that
    context or even freeze them entirely. Any such throttling should not affect

    <h3>Privacy and Security</h3>
    <section>
      <h3>Clock resolution</h3>
      <p>Access to accurate timing information, both for measurement and
      scheduling purposes, is a common requirement for many applications. For
      example, coordinating animations, sound, and other activity on the page
      requires access to high-resolution time to provide a good user
      experience. Similarly, measurement enables developers to track the
      performance of critical code components, detect regressions, and so
      on.</p>
      <p>However, access to the same accurate timing information can sometimes
      be also used for malicious purposes by an attacker to guess and infer
      data that they can't see or access otherwise. For example, cache attacks,
      statistical fingerprinting and microarchitectural attacks are a privacy
      and security concern where a malicious web site may use high resolution
      timing data of various browser or application-initiated operations to
      differentiate between subset of users, identify a particular user or
      reveal unrelated but same-process user data - see [[?CACHE-ATTACKS]] and
      [[SPECTRE]] for more background.</p>
      <p data-tests='timing-attack.html'>This specification defines an API that
      provides sub-millisecond time resolution, which is more accurate than the
      previously available millisecond resolution exposed by {{DOMTimeStamp}}.
      However, even without this new API an attacker may be able to obtain
      high-resolution estimates through repeat execution and statistical
      analysis. To ensure that the new API does not significantly improve the
      accuracy or speed of such attacks, the minimum resolution of the
      {{DOMHighResTimeStamp}} type should be inaccurate enough to prevent
      attacks: current minimum recommended resolution is no less than 5
      microseconds and, where necessary, should be set higher by the User
      Agent to address privacy and security concerns due to architecture or
      software constraints, or other considerations.</p>
      <p>In order to mitigate such attacks user agents may deploy any technique
      they deem necessary. Deployment of those techniques may vary based on the
      browser's architecture, the user's device, the content and its ability to
      maliciousely read cross-origin data, or other practical
      considerations.</p>
      <p>These techniques may include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Resolution reduction.</li>
        <li>Added jitter.</li>
        <li>Abuse detection and/or API call throttling.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Mitigating such timing side-channel attacks entirely is practically
      not possible: either all operations would have to execute in a time that
      does not vary based on the value of any confidential information, or, the
      application would need to be isolated from any time-related primitives
      (clock, timers, counters, etc). Neither is practical due to the
      associated complexity for the browser and application developers and the
      associated negative effects on performance and responsiveness of
      applications.</p>
      <div class="note">
        Clock resolution is an unsolved and evolving area of research, with no
        existing industry consensus or definitive set of recommendations that
        applies to all browsers. To track the discussion, refer to

      <h3>Clock drift</h3>
      <p>This specification also defines an API that provides sub-millisecond
      time resolution of the zero time of the time origin, which requires and
      exposes a <a>global monotonic clock</a> to the application, and that must
      be shared across all the browser contexts. The <a>global monotonic
      clock</a> does not need to be tied to physical time, but is recommended
      to be set with respect to the [[ECMA-262]] definition of <a>time</a> to
      avoid exposing new fingerprint entropy about the user — e.g. this time
      can already be easily obtained by the application, whereas exposing a new
      logical clock provides new information.</p>
      <p>However, even with above mechanism in place, the <a>global monotonic
      clock</a> may provide additional <a href=
      "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_drift">clock drift</a> resolution.
      Today, the application can timestamp the time-of-day and monotonic time
      values (via <a>Date.now()</a> and {{performance.now()}}) at multiple
      points within the same context and observe drift between them—e.g. due to
      automatic or user clock adjustments. With the {{performance.timeOrigin}}
      attribute, the attacker can also compare the time at which <a>time
      origin</a> is zero, as reported by the <a>global monotonic clock</a>,
      against the current time-of-day estimate of when it is zero (i.e.
      difference between `Date.now()-performance.now()` and
      `performance.timeOrigin`) and potentially observe clock drift between
      these clocks over a longer time period.</p>
      <p>In practice, the same time drift can be observed by an application
      across multiple navigations: the application can record logical time in
      each context and use a client or server time synchronization mechanism to
      infer changes in the user's clock. Similarly, lower-layer mechanisms such
      as TCP timestamps may reveal same high-resolution information to the
      server without the need for multiple visits. As such, the information
      provided by this API should not expose any significant or previously not
      available entropy about the user.</p>
