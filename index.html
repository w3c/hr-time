<ul>
  <li>Defines a precise definition of <a>time origin</a> for the purpose of all performance timeline related specifications;</li>
  <li>Provides the base definition for the <a>Performance</a> interface, including support for the <a>Performance.now</a> method in Web Workers [[WORKERS]];</li>

</ul>

</section>

<section id="introduction" class='informative'>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
The ECMAScript Language specification [[ECMA-262]] defines the Date object as a time value representing time in milliseconds since 01 January, 1970 UTC. For most purposes, this definition of time is sufficient as
these values represent time to millisecond precision for any instant that is within approximately 285,616 years from
01 January, 1970 UTC. The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WebIDL/#common-DOMTimeStamp">DOMTimeStamp</a> is defined similarly [[WebIDL]].
</p>

<p>
In practice, these definitions of time are subject to both clock skew and adjustment of the system clock. The value of time may not always be monotonically increasing and subsequent values may either decrease
or remain the same.
</p>

<p>
	For example, the following script may log a positive number, negative number, or zero.
  </p>
	<pre class='example highlight'>
var mark_start = Date.now();
doTask(); // Some task
if (window.console) window.console.log('Duration of task: ' + (Date.now() - mark_start));
	</pre>


<p>
For certain tasks this definition of time may not be sufficient as it does not allow for sub-millisecond resolution and is subject to system clock skew. For example,
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		When attempting to accurately measure the elapsed time of navigating to a Document, fetching of resources or execution of script, a monotonically increasing clock
		with sub-millisecond resolution is desired.
	</li>
	<li>
		When calculating the animation state from script, developers will need to accurately know the amount of time that has elapsed in the animation in order to properly update the
		next scene of the animation.
	</li>
	<li>
		When calculating the frame rate of a script based animation, developers will need sub-millisecond resolution in order to determine if an animation is drawing at 60 FPS.
		Without sub-millisecond resolution, a developer can only determine if an animation is drawing at 58.8 FPS or 62.5 FPS.
	</li>
	<li>
		In order to cue audio to a specific point in an animation or ensure that the audio is synchronized with the animation,
		developers will need to accurately know the amount of time elapsed in the animation and audio.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
This specification does not propose changing the behavior of <code>Date.now()</code> [[ECMA-262]] as it is genuinely useful in determining the current value of the calendar time and has a long history of
usage. The <a>DOMHighResTimeStamp</a> type and the <a>Performance.now</a> method of the
<a>Performance</a> interface resolve the issues summarized in this section by providing a monotonically increasing time value in sub-millisecond resolution.
</p>

<section id='examples' class='informative'>
<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>A developer may wish to construct a timeline of their entire application, including events from <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/workers/#worker">dedicated</a> or <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/workers/#sharedworker">shared workers</a>, which have a different <a>time origin</a>. To display such events on the same timeline, the application can obtain a <a>TransferableDOMHighResTimeStamp</a> and transfer it to another time origin, where it can then be resolved into a <a>DOMHighResTimeStamp</a> with respect to the receiver's time origin.</p>

<pre class="example highlight">

// ---- worker.js -----------------------------
// Shared worker script
onconnect = function(e) {
  var port = e.ports[0];
  port.onmessage = function(e) {
    // Time execution in worker
    var task_start = performance.now();
    result = runSomeWorkerTask();
    var task_end = performance.now();

    port.postMessage({
       task: 'Some worker task',
       task_start: performance.transferable(task_start),
       task_end: performance.transferable(task_end),
       result: result
    });
  }
}

// ---- application.js ------------------------
// Timing tasks in the document
var task_start = performance.now();
result = runSomeDocumentTask();
var task_end = performance.now();

plotEventOnTimeline({
  task: 'Some document task',
  task_start: task_start,
  task_end: task_end,
  result: result
});

// Translating worker timestamps into document's time origin
var worker = new SharedWorker('worker.js');
worker.port.onmessage = function (event) {
  var msg = event.data;

  // translate transferable timestamps into document's time origin
  // and plot the results on document's timeline
  plotEventOnTimeline({
    task: msg.task,
    task_start: msg.task_start.time(),
    task_end: msg.task_end.time(),
    result: msg.result
  });
}

<section  id="conformance">

<p>Some conformance requirements are phrased as requirements on attributes,
methods or objects. Such requirements are to be interpreted as requirements
on user agents. </p>

    <p>The IDL fragments in this specification must be interpreted as
    required for conforming IDL fragments, as described in the Web IDL
    specification. [[!WebIDL]]</p>

<section>
<h3>Time Origin</h3>

<p>The <dfn id="time-origin">time origin</dfn> is the time value from which time is measured:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html51/webappapis.html#global-object">global object</a> [[!HTML51]] is a <code>Window</code> object, the <a>time origin</a> must be equal to:
  <ul>
   <li>the time when the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html51/browsers.html#creating-a-new-browsing-context">browsing context is first created</a> if there is no previous document; </li>
   <li>otherwise, the time of the user confirming the navigation if a confirmation dialog is displayed during the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html51/browsers.html#prompt-to-unload-a-document">prompt to unload</a> algorithm;</li>
   <li>otherwise, the time of starting the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html51/browsers.html#navigate">navigation</a> responsible for loading the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html51/browsers.html#dom-document-2">Window object's newest Document object</a>.</li>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html51/webappapis.html#global-object">global object</a> is a <a href="https://w3c.github.io/workers/#the-workerglobalscope-common-interface"><code>WorkerGlobalScope</code></a> object, the <a>time origin</a> must be equal to the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/workers/#official-moment-of-creation">official moment of creation</a> of the worker. [[!WORKERS]] [[!SERVICE-WORKERS]]</li>
  <li>Otherwise, the <a>time origin</a> is undefined.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="dom-domhighrestimestamp">

<h3>The <code>DOMHighResTimeStamp</code> type</h3>

<p>
	The <a>DOMHighResTimeStamp</a> type is used to store a time value measured relative from the
	<a>time origin</a> or a time value that represents a duration
	between two  <a>DOMHighResTimeStamp</a>s.
</p>

<pre class='idl'>
typedef double DOMHighResTimeStamp;
</pre>

<p>A <a>DOMHighResTimeStamp</a> SHOULD represent a time in milliseconds accurate to 5 microseconds - see <a href="#privacy-security"></a>.</p>

<p class='note'>
If the User Agent is unable to provide a time value accurate to 5 microseconds due to hardware or software constraints, the User Agent can represent a <a>DOMHighResTimeStamp</a> as a time in milliseconds accurate to a millisecond.
</p>

</section>

<section id="dom-transferabledomhighrestimestamp">
<h3>The <code>TransferableDOMHighResTimeStamp</code> interface</h3>

<p>
  The <a>TransferableDOMHighResTimeStamp</a> interface is used to wrap a <a>DOMHighResTimeStamp</a> into an object that stores both the provided high-resolution time value (<a>wrappedTime</a>) and a reference to its <a>time origin</a> (<a>wrappedTimeOrigin</a>), such that it can be transfered to and resolved within a different <a>time origin</a>.
</p>

<pre class='idl'>
[Exposed=(Window,Worker)]
interface TransferableDOMHighResTimeStamp {
    DOMHighResTimeStamp time ();
};
</pre>

<p>The <dfn for='TransferableDOMHighResTimeStamp' data-lt='time'>time()</dfn> method MUST return a <a>DOMHighResTimeStamp</a> as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Let <var>currentTimeOrigin</var> be the <a>time origin</a> of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html51/webappapis.html#global-object">global object</a></li>
  <li>Return <var><a>wrappedTime</a></var> + (<var><a>wrappedTimeOrigin</a></var> - <var>currentTimeOrigin</var>)</li>
</ol>

</section>

<section>

<h3>The <code>Performance</code> interface</h3>
<pre class='idl'>
[Exposed=(Window,Worker)]
interface Performance : EventTarget {
    DOMHighResTimeStamp now ();
    TransferableDOMHighResTimeStamp transferable (DOMHighResTimeStamp time);
    serializer = {attribute};
};
</pre>

<p>The <dfn for='Performance' data-lt='now'>now()</dfn> method MUST
	return a <a>DOMHighResTimeStamp</a> representing the time in milliseconds
	from the <a>time origin</a> to the occurrence of the call to the <a>Performance.now</a> method.
</p>

<p>The <dfn for='Performance' data-lt='transferable'>transferable(DOMHighResTimestamp time)</dfn> method MUST
  return a <a>TransferableDOMHighResTimeStamp</a> that stores the provided <var>time</var> (<dfn>wrappedTime</dfn>), and time origin (<dfn>wrappedTimeOrigin</dfn>) of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html51/webappapis.html#global-object">global object</a> associated with the performance object that is the <code>this</code> value for the <code>Performance.transferable</code> call.</p>
</p>

</section>

<section>

<h3>The <code>performance</code> attribute</h3>

<p>
  The <a>GlobalPerformance.performance</a> attribute allows access to performance related attributes and methods from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html51/webappapis.html#global-object">global object</a>.
</p>
<pre class='idl'>
[NoInterfaceObject, Exposed=(Window,Worker)]
interface GlobalPerformance {
    [Replaceable]
    readonly    attribute Performance performance;
};

Window implements GlobalPerformance;
WorkerGlobalScope implements GlobalPerformance;
</pre>

</section>

<section id="monotonic-clock">
<h3>Monotonic Clock</h3>

<p>
The time values returned when calling the <a>Performance.now</a> method on <a>Performance</a> objects with the same <a>time origin</a> MUST be monotonically increasing and not subject to system clock
adjustments or system clock skew. The difference between any two chronologically recorded time values returned from the
<a>Performance.now</a> method MUST never be negative if the two time values have the same <a>time origin</a>.</p>

<p>The time values returned when calling the <a>Performance.now</a> method  SHOULD be initialized with respect to a global monotonic clock, such that chronologically recorded high-resolution time values originating in different <a>time origin</a>'s can be transfered and accurately resolved within the same time origin.</p>
</section>

<section id="privacy-security">

<h3>Privacy and Security</h3>
<p>
Cache attacks and statistical fingerprinting is a privacy and security concern where a malicious web site may use high resolution timing data of various browser or application-initiated operations to differentiate between subset of users, and in some cases identify a particular user - see [[CACHE-ATTACKS]]. To mitigate such attacks, the recommended minimum resolution of the <a>Performance</a> interface should be set to 5 microseconds.</p>
