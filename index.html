  <section id="introduction" class='informative'>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The ECMAScript Language specification [[ECMA-262]] defines the Date
    object as a time value representing time in milliseconds since 01 January,
    1970 UTC. For most purposes, this definition of time is sufficient as these
    values represent time to millisecond precision for any instant that is
    within approximately 285,616 years from 01 January, 1970 UTC. The
    [DOMTimeStamp] is defined similarly [[WebIDL]].</p>
    <p>In practice, these definitions of time are subject to both clock skew
    and adjustment of the system clock. The value of time may not always be
    monotonically increasing and subsequent values may either decrease or
    remain the same.</p>
    <p>For example, the following script may record a positive number, negative
    number, or zero for computed `duration`:</p>
    <pre class='example highlight'>
var mark_start = Date.now();
doTask(); // Some task
var duration = Date.now() - mark_start;
</pre>
    <p>For certain tasks this definition of time may not be sufficient as it
    does not allow for sub-millisecond resolution and is subject to system
    clock skew. For example,</p>
    <ul>
      <li>When attempting to accurately measure the elapsed time of navigating
      to a Document, fetching of resources or execution of script, a
      monotonically increasing clock with sub-millisecond resolution is
      desired.</li>
      <li>When calculating the animation state from script, developers will
      need to accurately know the amount of time that has elapsed in the
      animation in order to properly update the next scene of the
      animation.</li>
      <li>When calculating the frame rate of a script based animation,
      developers will need sub-millisecond resolution in order to determine if
      an animation is drawing at 60 FPS. Without sub-millisecond resolution, a
      developer can only determine if an animation is drawing at 58.8 FPS or
      62.5 FPS.</li>
      <li>When attempting to cue audio to a specific point in an animation or
      ensure that the audio is synchronized with the animation, developers will
      need to accurately know the amount of time elapsed in the animation and
      audio.</li>
      <li>When multiple contexts need to synchronize work with sub-millisecond
      resolution (e.g. when using [dedicated][dedicatedworker] or
      [shared][sharedworker] workers to drive animation, audio, etc., in a
      renderer context), or to create a unified view of the event
      timeline.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This specification does not propose changing the behavior of
    <code>Date.now()</code> [[ECMA-262]] as it is genuinely useful in
    determining the current value of the calendar time and has a long history
    of usage. The <a>DOMHighResTimeStamp</a> type, <a>performance.now</a>
    method, and <a>performance.timeOrigin</a> attribute of the
    <a>Performance</a> interface resolve above issues by providing
    monotonically increasing time values with sub-millisecond resolution.</p>
    <section id='examples' class='informative'>
      <h3>Examples</h3>
      <p>A developer may wish to construct a timeline of their entire
      application, including events from [dedicated][dedicatedworker] or
      [shared workers][sharedworker], which have different <a>time
      origin</a>'s. To display such events on the same timeline, the
      application can translate the <a>DOMHighResTimeStamp</a>'s with the help
      of the <a>performance.timeOrigin</a> attribute.</p>
      <pre class="example highlight">
// ---- worker.js -----------------------------
// Shared worker script
onconnect = function(e) {
  var port = e.ports[0];
  port.onmessage = function(e) {
    // Time execution in worker
    var task_start = performance.now();
    result = runSomeWorkerTask();
    var task_end = performance.now();

    port.postMessage({
       'task': 'Some worker task',
       'time_origin': performance.timeOrigin,
       'start_time': task_start,
       'end_time': task_end,
       'result': result
    });
  }
}

// ---- application.js ------------------------
// Timing tasks in the document
var task_start = performance.now();
runSomeApplicationTask();
var task_end = performance.now();

// developer provided method to upload runtime performance data
reportEventToAnalytics({
  'task': 'Some document task',
  'start_time': task_start,
  'duration': task_end - task_start
});

// Translating worker timestamps into document's time origin
var worker = new SharedWorker('worker.js');
worker.port.onmessage = function (event) {
  var msg = event.data;

  // calculate time origin offset between document and sender context's
  var offset = msg.time_origin - performance.timeOrigin;

  // translate timestamps into document's time origin
  msg.start_time = msg.start_time + offset;
  msg.end_time = msg.end_time + offset;
  msg.task = 'Some worker task'

  reportEventToAnalytics(msg);

      object</a> [[!HTML51]] is a <code>Window</code> object, the <a>time
      origin</a> MUST be equal to:
        <ul>

            prompt to unload</a> algorithm;
          </li>
          <li>otherwise, the time of starting the <a href=

        moment of creation</a> of the worker. [[!WORKERS]] [[!SERVICE-WORKERS]]
      </li>
      <li>Otherwise, the <a>time origin</a> is undefined.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The <dfn id="time-origin-timestamp">time origin timestamp</dfn> is the
    high resolution time value at which <a>time origin</a> is zero. On getting,
    the `timeOrigin` attribute MUST return:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If <a>time origin</a> is undefined, return `undefined`.
      </li>
      <li>Otherwise, the sum of the high resolution UTC epoch time at which the
      <a>global monotonic clock</a> is zero and the time value of the <a>global
      monotonic clock</a> at which the <a>time origin</a> is zero.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">The <a>time origin timestamp</a> and the value returned by
    `Date.now()` executed at "zero time" can differ because the former is
    recorded with respect to a global monotonic clock that is not subject to
    system and user clock adjustments, clock skew, and so on—see <a href=

  <section id="privacy-security">
    <h3>Privacy and Security</h3>
    <p>Access to accurate timing information, both for measurement and
    scheduling purposes, is a common requirement for many applications. For
    example, coordinating animations, sound, and other activity on the page
    requires access to high-resolution time to provide a good user experience.
    Similarly, measurement enables developers to track the performance of
    critical code components, detect regressions, and so on.</p>
    <p>However, access to the same accurate timing information can sometimes be
    also used for malicious purposes by an attacker to guess and infer data
    that they can't see or access otherwise. For example, cache attacks and
    statistical fingerprinting is a privacy and security concern where a
    malicious web site may use high resolution timing data of various browser
    or application-initiated operations to differentiate between subset of
    users, and in some cases identify a particular user - see
    [[CACHE-ATTACKS]].</p>
    <p>This specification defines an API that provides sub-millisecond time
    resolution, which is more accurate than the previously available
    millisecond resolution exposed by [DOMTimeStamp]. However, even without
    this new API an attacker may be able to obtain high-resolution estimates
    through repeat execution and statistical analysis. To ensure that the new
    API does not significantly improve the accuracy or speed of such attacks,
    the recommended minimum resolution of the <a>Performance</a> interface
    should be set to 5 microseconds.</p>
    <p>Mitigating such timing side-channel attacks entirely is practically not
    possible: either all operations would have to execute in a time that does
    not vary based on the value of any confidential information, or, the
    application would need to be isolated from any time-related primitives
    (clock, timers, counters, etc). Neither is practical due to the associated
    complexity for the browser and application developers and the associated
    negative effects on performance and responsiveness of applications.</p>
    <p>This specification also defines a mechanism to translate high resolution
    timestamps across <a>time origin</a>'s, which requires a global monotonic
    clock and may provide additional [clock drift] resolution. Today, the
    attacker can timestamp the time-of-day and monotonic time values (via
    `Date.now()` and `performance.now()`) at multiple points within the same
    context and observe drift between them. With the
    <a>performance.timeOrigin</a> attribute, the attacker can also compare the
    time at which <a>time origin</a> is zero, as reported by the global monotic
    clock, against the current time-of-day estimate of when it is zero (i.e.
    difference between `Date.now()-performance.now()` and
    `performance.timeOrigin`) and observe drift between the zero time of the
    global monotic clock and the current time. To reduce accuracy of such
    attacks the user agent is recommended to periodically update the zero time
    time-of-day reference of its global monotonic clock.</p>
