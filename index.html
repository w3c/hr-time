      <h2>
        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        The ECMAScript Language specification [[ECMA-262]] defines the
        <code><dfn data-no-export="" data-cite=
        "ECMA-262#sec-date-objects">Date</dfn></code> object as a time value
        representing time in milliseconds since 01 January, 1970 UTC. For most
        purposes, this definition of time is sufficient as these values
        represent time to millisecond precision for any instant that is within
        approximately 285,616 years from 01 January, 1970 UTC.
      </p>
      <p>
        In practice, these definitions of time are subject to both clock skew
        and adjustment of the system clock. The value of time may not always be
        monotonically increasing and subsequent values may either decrease or
        remain the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, the following script may record a positive number,
        negative number, or zero for computed <code>duration</code>:
      </p>
      <pre class="example js">
      var mark_start = Date.now();
      doTask(); // Some task
      var duration = Date.now() - mark_start;
    </pre>
      <p>
        For certain tasks this definition of time may not be sufficient as it:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Does not have a stable monotonic clock, and as a result, it is
        subject to system clock skew.
        </li>
        <li>Does not provide sub-millisecond time resolution.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This specification does not propose changing the behavior of
        <code><dfn data-no-export="" data-cite=
        "ecma-262#sec-date.now">Date.now()</dfn></code> [[ECMA-262]] as it is
        genuinely useful in determining the current value of the calendar time
        and has a long history of usage. The {{DOMHighResTimeStamp}} type,
        {{Performance}}.{{Performance/now()}} method, and
        {{Performance}}.{{Performance/timeOrigin}} attributes of the
        {{Performance}} interface resolve the above issues by providing
        monotonically increasing time values with sub-millisecond resolution.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        Providing sub-millisecond resolution is not a mandatory part of this
        specification. Implementations may choose to limit the timer resolution
        they expose for privacy and security reasons, and not expose
        sub-millisecond timers. Use-cases that rely on sub-millisecond
        resolution may not be satisfied when that happens.
      </p>
      <section id="use-cases" class="informative">
        <h3>
          Use-cases
        </h3>
        <p>
          This specification defines a few different capabilities: it provides
          timestamps based on a stable, monotonic clock, comparable across
          contexts, with potential sub-millisecond resolution.
        </p>
        <p>
          The need for a stable monotonic clock when talking about performance
          measurements stems from the fact that unrelated clock skew can
          distort measurements and render them useless. For example, when
          attempting to accurately measure the elapsed time of navigating to a
          Document, fetching of resources or execution of script, a
          monotonically increasing clock with sub-millisecond resolution is
          desired.
        </p>
        <p>
          Comparing timestamps between contexts is essential e.g. when
          synchronizing work between a {{Worker}} and the main thread or when
          instrumenting such work in order to create a unified view of the
          event timeline.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, the need for sub-millisecond timers revolves around the
          following use-cases:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ability to schedule work in sub-millisecond intervals. That is
          particularly important on the main thread, where work can interfere
          with frame rendering which needs to happen in short and regular
          intervals, to avoid user-visible jank.
          </li>
          <li>When calculating the frame rate of a script-based animation,
          developers will need sub-millisecond resolution in order to determine
          if an animation is drawing at 60 FPS. Without sub-millisecond
          resolution, a developer can only determine if an animation is drawing
          at 58.8 FPS (1000ms / 16) or 62.5 FPS (1000ms / 17).
          </li>
          <li>When collecting in-the-wild measurements of JS code (e.g. using
          User-Timing), developers may be interested in gathering
          sub-milliseconds timing of their functions, to catch regressions
          early.
          </li>
          <li>When attempting to cue audio to a specific point in an animation
          or ensure that the audio and animation are perfectly synchronized,
          developers will need to accurately measure the amount of time
          elapsed.
          </li>
        </ul>

          which have different <a>time origin</a>s. To display such events on
          the same timeline, the application can translate the

        The user agent can reset its <a>shared monotonic clock</a> across
        browser restarts, or whenever starting an isolated browsing
        session—e.g. incognito or similar browsing mode. As a result,
        developers should not use shared timestamps as absolute time that holds
        its monotonic properties across all past, present, and future contexts;
        in practice, the monotonic properties only apply for contexts that can
        reach each other by exchanging messages via one of the provided
        messaging mechanisms - e.g. `postMessage`, `BroadcastChannel`, etc.

      <p class="note">
        In certain scenarios (e.g. when a tab is backgrounded), the user agent
        may choose to throttle timers and periodic callbacks run in that
        context or even freeze them entirely. Any such throttling should not
        affect the resolution or accuracy of the time returned by the monotonic
        clock.

          Clock resolution
        </h3>
        <p>
          Access to accurate timing information, both for measurement and
          scheduling purposes, is a common requirement for many applications.
          For example, coordinating animations, sound, and other activity on
          the page requires access to high-resolution time to provide a good
          user experience. Similarly, measurement enables developers to track
          the performance of critical code components, detect regressions, and
          so on.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, access to the same accurate timing information can sometimes
          be also used for malicious purposes by an attacker to guess and infer
          data that they can't see or access otherwise. For example, cache
          attacks, statistical fingerprinting and micro-architectural attacks
          are a privacy and security concern where a malicious web site may use
          high resolution timing data of various browser or
          application-initiated operations to differentiate between subset of
          users, identify a particular user or reveal unrelated but
          same-process user data - see [[?CACHE-ATTACKS]] and [[SPECTRE]] for
          more background.
        </p>
        <p data-tests="timing-attack.html">
          This specification defines an API that provides sub-millisecond time
          resolution, which is more accurate than the previously available
          millisecond resolution exposed by {{EpochTimeStamp}}. However, even
          without this new API an attacker may be able to obtain
          high-resolution estimates through repeat execution and statistical
          analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
          To ensure that the new API does not significantly improve the
          accuracy or speed of such attacks, the minimum resolution of the
          {{DOMHighResTimeStamp}} type should be inaccurate enough to prevent
          attacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where necessary, the user agent should set higher resolution values
          to |time resolution| in [=coarsen time=]'s processing model, to
          address privacy and security concerns due to architecture or software
          constraints, or other considerations.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to mitigate such attacks user agents may deploy any
          technique they deem necessary. Deployment of those techniques may
          vary based on the browser's architecture, the user's device, the
          content and its ability to maliciously read cross-origin data, or
          other practical considerations.
        </p>
        <p>
          These techniques may include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Resolution reduction.
          </li>
          <li>Added jitter.
          </li>
          <li>Abuse detection and/or API call throttling.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Mitigating such timing side-channel attacks entirely is practically
          impossible: either all operations would have to execute in a time
          that does not vary based on the value of any confidential
          information, or the application would need to be isolated from any
          time-related primitives (clock, timers, counters, etc). Neither is
          practical due to the associated complexity for the browser and
          application developers and the associated negative effects on
          performance and responsiveness of applications.

          Clock resolution is an unsolved and evolving area of research, with
          no existing industry consensus or definitive set of recommendations
          that applies to all browsers. To track the discussion, refer to

          Clock drift
        </h3>
        <p>
          This specification also defines an API that provides sub-millisecond
          time resolution of the zero time of the time origin, which requires
          and exposes a <a>shared monotonic clock</a> to the application, and
          that must be shared across all the browser contexts. The <a>shared
          monotonic clock</a> does not need to be tied to physical time, but is
          recommended to be set with respect to the [[ECMA-262]] definition of
          <a>time</a> to avoid exposing new fingerprint entropy about the user
          — e.g. this time can already be easily obtained by the application,
          whereas exposing a new logical clock provides new information.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, even with the above mechanism in place, the <a>shared
          monotonic clock</a> may provide additional <a href=
          "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_drift">clock drift</a>
          resolution. Today, the application can timestamp the time-of-day and
          monotonic time values (via <a>Date.now()</a> and
          {{Performance/now()}}) at multiple points within the same context and
          observe drift between them—e.g. due to automatic or user clock
          adjustments. With the {{Performance/timeOrigin}} attribute, the
          attacker can also compare the time at which <a>time origin</a> is
          zero, as reported by the <a>shared monotonic clock</a>, against the
          current time-of-day estimate of when it is zero (i.e. the difference
          between `Date.now() - performance.now()` and
          `performance.timeOrigin`) and potentially observe clock drift between
          these clocks over a longer time period.
        </p>
        <p>
          In practice, the same time drift can be observed by an application
          across multiple navigations: the application can record the logical
          time in each context and use a client or server time synchronization
          mechanism to infer changes in the user's clock. Similarly,
          lower-layer mechanisms such as TCP timestamps may reveal the same
          high-resolution information to the server without the need for
          multiple visits. As such, the information provided by this API should
          not expose any significant or previously unavailable entropy about
          the user.
