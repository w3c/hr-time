    <p>This specification defines an API that provides the current time in
    sub-millisecond resolution and such that it is not subject to system clock
    skew or adjustments.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="sotd">
    <p>High Resolution Time Level 3 replaces the second version of High
    Resolution Time [[HR-TIME-2]] and includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Defines <a>performance.timeOrigin</a> attribute that provides the
      global time of the zero time of <a>time origin</a>;
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section id="introduction" class='informative'>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The ECMAScript Language specification [[ECMA-262]] defines the Date
    object as a time value representing time in milliseconds since 01 January,
    1970 UTC. For most purposes, this definition of time is sufficient as these
    values represent time to millisecond precision for any instant that is
    within approximately 285,616 years from 01 January, 1970 UTC. The
    [DOMTimeStamp] is defined similarly [[WebIDL]].</p>
    <p>In practice, these definitions of time are subject to both clock skew
    and adjustment of the system clock. The value of time may not always be
    monotonically increasing and subsequent values may either decrease or
    remain the same.</p>
    <p>For example, the following script may record a positive number, negative
    number, or zero for computed `duration`:</p>
    <pre class='example highlight'>
var mark_start = Date.now();
doTask(); // Some task
var duration = Date.now() - mark_start;
</pre>
    <p>For certain tasks this definition of time may not be sufficient as it
    does not allow for sub-millisecond resolution and is subject to system
    clock skew. For example,</p>
    <ul>
      <li>When attempting to accurately measure the elapsed time of navigating
      to a Document, fetching of resources or execution of script, a
      monotonically increasing clock with sub-millisecond resolution is
      desired.</li>
      <li>When calculating the animation state from script, developers will
      need to accurately know the amount of time that has elapsed in the
      animation in order to properly update the next scene of the
      animation.</li>
      <li>When calculating the frame rate of a script based animation,
      developers will need sub-millisecond resolution in order to determine if
      an animation is drawing at 60 FPS. Without sub-millisecond resolution, a
      developer can only determine if an animation is drawing at 58.8 FPS or
      62.5 FPS.</li>
      <li>When attempting to cue audio to a specific point in an animation or
      ensure that the audio is synchronized with the animation, developers will
      need to accurately know the amount of time elapsed in the animation and
      audio.</li>
      <li>When multiple contexts need to synchronize work with sub-millisecond
      resolution (e.g. when using [dedicated][dedicatedworker] or
      [shared][sharedworker] workers to drive animation, audio, etc., in a
      renderer context), or to create a unified view of the event
      timeline.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This specification does not propose changing the behavior of
    <code>Date.now()</code> [[ECMA-262]] as it is genuinely useful in
    determining the current value of the calendar time and has a long history
    of usage. The <a>DOMHighResTimeStamp</a> type, <a>performance.now</a>
    method, and <a>performance.timeOrigin</a> attributes of the
    <a>Performance</a> interface resolve above issues by providing
    monotonically increasing time values with sub-millisecond resolution.</p>
    <section id='examples' class='informative'>
      <h3>Examples</h3>
      <p>A developer may wish to construct a timeline of their entire
      application, including events from [dedicated][dedicatedworker] or
      [shared workers][sharedworker], which have different <a>time
      origin</a>'s. To display such events on the same timeline, the
      application can translate the <a>DOMHighResTimeStamp</a>'s with the help
      of the <a>performance.timeOrigin</a> attribute.</p>
      <pre class="example highlight">
// ---- worker.js -----------------------------
// Shared worker script
onconnect = function(e) {
  var port = e.ports[0];
  port.onmessage = function(e) {
    // Time execution in worker
    var task_start = performance.now();
    result = runSomeWorkerTask();
    var task_end = performance.now();

    // Send results and epoch-relative timestamps to another context
    port.postMessage({
       'task': 'Some worker task',
       'start_time': task_start + performance.timeOrigin,
       'end_time': task_end + performance.timeOrigin,
       'result': result
    });
  }
}

// ---- application.js ------------------------
// Timing tasks in the document
var task_start = performance.now();
runSomeApplicationTask();
var task_end = performance.now();

// developer provided method to upload runtime performance data
reportEventToAnalytics({
  'task': 'Some document task',
  'start_time': task_start,
  'duration': task_end - task_start
});

// Translating worker timestamps into document's time origin
var worker = new SharedWorker('worker.js');
worker.port.onmessage = function (event) {
  var msg = event.data;

  // translate epoch-relative timestamps into document's time origin
  msg.start_time = msg.start_time - performance.timeOrigin;
  msg.end_time = msg.end_time - performance.timeOrigin;

  reportEventToAnalytics(msg);

    <p>Some conformance requirements are phrased as requirements on attributes,
    methods or objects. Such requirements are to be interpreted as requirements

    <h3>Time Origin</h3>
    <p>The <dfn id="time-origin">time origin</dfn> is the time value from which
    time is measured:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the <a href=
      "https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/webappapis.html#global-object">global
      object</a> [[!HTML51]] is a <code>Window</code> object, the <a>time

            browsing context is first created</a> if there is no previous
            document;
          </li>
          <li>otherwise, the time of the user confirming the navigation if a
          confirmation dialog is displayed during the <a href=
          "https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/browsers.html#prompt-to-unload">
            prompt to unload</a> algorithm;
          </li>
          <li>otherwise, the time of starting the <a href=

      object</a> is a <code>[WorkerGlobalScope]</code> object, the <a>time origin</a> MUST
        be equal to the [official moment of creation] of the worker. [[!WORKERS]]
      </li>
      <li>Otherwise, the <a>time origin</a> is undefined.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The <dfn id="time-origin-timestamp">time origin timestamp</dfn> is the
    high resolution time value at which <a>time origin</a> is zero. To obtain
    the <a>time origin timestamp</a> given a [global object]
    (<var>global</var>):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Assert that <var>global</var>'s <a>time origin</a> is not
      undefined.</li>
      <li>Let <var>t1</var> be the <a>DOMHighResTimeStamp</a> representing the
      high resolution [Unix time] at which the <a>global monotonic clock</a> is
      zero.</li>
      <li>Let <var>t2</var> be the <a>DOMHighResTimeStamp</a> representing the
      high resolution time value of the <a>global monotonic clock</a> at

      <li>Return the sum of <var>t1</var> and <var>t2</var>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">The <a>time origin timestamp</a> and the value returned by
    `Date.now()` executed at "zero time" can differ because the former is
    recorded with respect to a global monotonic clock that is not subject to
    system and user clock adjustments, clock skew, and so on—see <a href=

  <section id="monotonic-clock">
    <h3>Monotonic Clock</h3>
    <p>The time values returned when calling the <a>Performance.now</a> method
    on <a>Performance</a> objects with the same <a>time origin</a> MUST use the
    same <dfn>monotonic clock</dfn> that is monotonically increasing and not

    have the same <a>time origin</a>.</p>
    <p>The time values returned when getting <a>performance.timeOrigin</a> MUST
    use the same <dfn>global monotonic clock</dfn> that is shared by <a>time
    origin</a>'s, is monotonically increasing and not subject to system clock
    adjustments or system clock skew, and whose reference point is the Unix
    time—see <a href="#privacy-security"></a>.</p>
    <p class="note">The user agent can reset its global monotonic clock across
    browser restarts, or whenever starting an isolated browsing session—e.g.
    incognito or similar browsing mode. As a result, developers should not use
    global timestamps as absolute time that holds its monotonic properties
    across all past, present, and future contexts; in practice, the monotonic
    properties only apply for contexts that can reach other by exchanging
    messages via one of the provided messaging mechanisms - e.g. `postMessage`,
    `BroadcastChannel`, etc.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="privacy-security">
    <h3>Privacy and Security</h3>
    <section>
      <h3>Clock resolution</h3>
      <p>Access to accurate timing information, both for measurement and
      scheduling purposes, is a common requirement for many applications. For
      example, coordinating animations, sound, and other activity on the page
      requires access to high-resolution time to provide a good user
      experience. Similarly, measurement enables developers to track the
      performance of critical code components, detect regressions, and so
      on.</p>
      <p>However, access to the same accurate timing information can sometimes
      be also used for malicious purposes by an attacker to guess and infer
      data that they can't see or access otherwise. For example, cache attacks
      and statistical fingerprinting is a privacy and security concern where a
      malicious web site may use high resolution timing data of various browser
      or application-initiated operations to differentiate between subset of
      users, and in some cases identify a particular user - see
      [[CACHE-ATTACKS]].</p>
      <p>This specification defines an API that provides sub-millisecond time
      resolution, which is more accurate than the previously available
      millisecond resolution exposed by [DOMTimeStamp]. However, even without
      this new API an attacker may be able to obtain high-resolution estimates
      through repeat execution and statistical analysis. To ensure that the new
      API does not significantly improve the accuracy or speed of such attacks,
      the recommended minimum resolution of the <a>Performance</a> interface
      should be set to 5 microseconds.</p>
      <p>Mitigating such timing side-channel attacks entirely is practically
      not possible: either all operations would have to execute in a time that
      does not vary based on the value of any confidential information, or, the
      application would need to be isolated from any time-related primitives
      (clock, timers, counters, etc). Neither is practical due to the
      associated complexity for the browser and application developers and the
      associated negative effects on performance and responsiveness of
      applications.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Clock drift</h3>
      <p>This specification also defines an API that provides sub-millisecond
      time resolution of the zero time of the time origin, which requires and
      exposes a <a>global monotonic clock</a> to the application, and that must
      be shared across all the browser contexts. The <a>global monotonic
      clock</a> does not need to be tied to physical time, but is recommended
      to be set with respect to the [Unix time] to avoid exposing new
      fingerprint entropy about the user—e.g. this time can already be easily
      obtained by the application, whereas exposing a new logical clock
      provides new information.</p>
      <p>However, even with above mechanism in place, the <a>global monotonic
      clock</a> may provide additional [clock drift] resolution. Today, the
      application can timestamp the time-of-day and monotonic time values (via
      `Date.now()` and `performance.now()`) at multiple points within the same
      context and observe drift between them—e.g. due to automatic or user
      clock adjustments. With the <a>performance.timeOrigin</a> attribute, the
      attacker can also compare the time at which <a>time origin</a> is zero,
      as reported by the <a>global monotonic clock</a>, against the current
      time-of-day estimate of when it is zero (i.e. difference between
      `Date.now()-performance.now()` and `performance.timeOrigin`) and
      potentially observe clock drift between these clocks over a longer time
      period.</p>
      <p>In practice, the same time drift can be observed by an application
      across multiple navigations: the application can record logical time in
      each context and use a client or server time synchronization mechanism to
      infer changes in the user's clock. Similarly, lower-layer mechanisms such
      as TCP timestamps may reveal same high-resolution information to the
      server without the need for multiple visits. As such, the information
      provided by this API should not expose any significant or previously not
      available entropy about the user.</p>
